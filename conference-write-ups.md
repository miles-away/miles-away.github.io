# Conference Write-Ups
I'm a keen conference goer and will document my experience of them here.
Opinions in this write-ups are my own and I've to convey the detail of the talks the best I could but be aware there could be some inaccuries featured.
Open to any constructive comments.

## Showcase
Featured/most recent conferences will be included in the showcase.

### Coming Soon: BSides Liverpool 2019
The first cyber/information security conference I attended was BSides Liverpool on 29/06/19. My report from the BSides Liverpool conference [features here](BSides Liverpool Report - Miles Eastwood.pdf) and contains my own views as well as best endeavours to explain each talk I attended.

### Coming Soon: BSidesMCR 2019
After attending BSides Liverpool I seem to have caught the bug as I was drawn to attend the BSidesMCR conference in August 2019. My report from the BSidesMCR conference can be [found here](BSidesMCR Report - Miles Eastwood.pdf) and contains my own views as well as best endeavours to explain each talk I attended.
