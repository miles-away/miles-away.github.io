# Hello World!
Big cliche I know but all I could think of to start with.
Anyway, welcome to my blog where I'll be attempting to share my experience (or inexperience) of the cyber security world.
Contents will most likely be blog posts on various topics, conference write-ups some Capture the Flag walkthroughs - well at least for now.
