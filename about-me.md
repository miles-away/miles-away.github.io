# New blog, who dis?
A good question and in truth, who really knows.

# Really though...
My name is Miles and I'm a relative newbie to Information Security - I've been working through various placements and studying for my degree for the last three years through an apprenticeship. My ambitions lie in DFIR and the security of Operational Technologies/Security Architecture.

Besides work I enjoy taking on CTFs as well as other challenges to further my abilities. This has site grown from a desire to showcase that, share information with like-minded people and implement a platform to advertise the cyber/information security profession for those considering a career in it.

Taking a step away from the job and job related alike, other interests lie in video games (currently on Xbox One, a little bit of PC and a recent resurgence of the Gameboy Advance), socialising with friends (cinema, pubs/clubs, etc.) and sometimes hitting the gym. A recent addition to this is attendance at conventions as attending [MCM Scotland 2019](https://www.mcmcomiccon.com/scotland) in Glasgow seems to have given me a bug as I'm already thinking of going to other events across the country.
